#summary Programming caffeine style

= Classes =
  * Classes must have a descriptive header doc to explain the use of the class
  * Functions should be well commented for user documentation.
  * Public variables should be commented
  * Where possible, document @PARAM and @THROW

  * Avoid Dynamic
  * Avoid untyped
  * Avoid cast
  * Avoid Reflect

= Haxe Std Library +

Caffeine-hx includes files from the Haxe standard library that have been modified by Caffeine developers. When modifying a standard library file, any function that is modified _must be_ enclosed within a special comment block.
